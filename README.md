This was created as a final project for a CET 492 class.

First program the FPGA. 
Then run the software on matlab. The script opens the image as binary read and then 
sends the image over a serial com port to the rs 232 port on the FPGA.
The FPGA Stores the image in block ram.
The FPGA then displays the image from the RAM to a monitor over VGA.
